# Pokemon Explorer - React Interview Challenge
This is the base project for the web interview at BeyondOne. It would be required to clone and run this project before your interview.

## Requirements
You need to have Visual Studio Code. Clone the repository. Open the project in VS Code. Build and run the project. If everything goes well, you should see list of Pokemons in the browser.

We would be expanding the functionality of this starter app during the interview.
